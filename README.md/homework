Your last homework is to have a "plan" for your final project. Turn in a markdown file with:
•	your partner (or telling me you don't have a partner)
•	your data
o	What's in it, what's interesting about it, where it comes from
•	an introduction paragraph to the data
•	a few questions that you plan to ask about the data/graphs you plan to make
