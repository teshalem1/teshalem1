# Final Project Plan

# Partner
I don't have a partner for this project.

# Data
The data set I'll be using is the "Board Game Geek Reviews" data set.

# What's in it, What's Interesting About It, Where It Comes From
This data set contains detailed information about various board games,
including their ratings, number of reviews, publication year, playtime, 
and player count, among other attributes. The data has been sourced from the BoardGameGeek website,
which is a large community-driven platform for board game enthusiasts.
What's fascinating about this data set is its richness and diversity, 
allowing for a wide range of analyses and insights into gaming trends, preferences,
and the evolution of board games over time.

# Introduction Paragraph to the Data
Board games have been a significant part of social entertainment for centuries, evolving from simple
traditional games to complex strategy-based games. The "Board Game Geek Reviews" data set offers a
comprehensive look into this world, capturing various attributes of board games rated and reviewed by
enthusiasts on the BoardGameGeek platform. With data spanning from publication years to user ratings 
and the complexity of games, this data set provides a fertile ground for analyzing trends,
player preferences, and the development of the board game industry.

# Questions to Ask About the Data/Graphs to Make
1. **What are the top-rated board games of all time?**
   - **Graph:** A bar plot showing the top 10 highest-rated games.
   
2. **How has the popularity of board games changed over the years?**
   - **Graph:** A line graph showing the number of games published each year.
   
3. **Is there a correlation between the complexity of a game and its rating?**

4. **What are the most common themes or categories among top-rated games?**
